# Currency convert mobile application
This is a simple mobile application which when instructed to convert a currency from one to another will return the converted amount.

## How does it work?
* This app is built using React-Native for frontend and Python Flask for backend.
* It also uses Hasura data api for inserting or fetching data from DB and Hasura Auth API for user authentication.
* The user has to initially signup using his/her username, e-mail ID and password and login using the same.
* Once the user logs in, a chat screen opens where the user can make queries such as 'convert 1 rupee to dollar' or 'convert 3 dollars to rupee' etc.
* These queries are sent to the bot which replies with the converted amount.
* The currency conversion bot is implemented using DialogFlow(api.ai).
* Once the user has finished with all the queries, he/she has to logout.
